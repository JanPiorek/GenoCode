# GenoCode reference

Every statement, function, input and constant in GenoCode, one entry each: how it's written, what
its parameters are, what it gives back, and an example. [The language](LANGUAGE.md) explains how
GenoCode works as a whole and is the definition when the two differ; each entry here links to the
part of it that goes deeper.

## How to read an entry

Each entry has some of these:

- **Syntax**: how it's written. Words in the syntax that aren't GenoCode's own words, such as
  `distance` in `forward distance`, stand for values you write in; **Parameters** says what each
  one is. `{ … }` stands for a block of statements. When there are several lines, each is one way
  to write it.
- **Parameters**: each value it takes, with its type and meaning. Types are the ones in
  [Values and types](LANGUAGE.md#5-values-and-types): number, bool, vector, colour, gradient,
  shape, pattern, pattern kind, scheme, finish, way of mixing, list and picture. **Any** means a
  value of any type.
- **Returns**: what a function gives back.
- **Used in**: where it's allowed. **Creature code** means a creature's top level and its parts.
  Functions, background blocks, dance blocks and pattern code each allow less, as listed.
- **Remarks**: rules and details worth knowing.
- **Example**: code you can paste into a creature. Longer examples are whole files.

A **whole number** parameter is rounded to the nearest whole number, with halves rounded up. Angles
are always in degrees.

## 1. Files

### creature

Starts a creature file. It must be the file's first line.

```text
creature Name
```

| Parameter | Type | Description                                                              |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Name`    | name | The creature's name: letters, digits and `_`, not starting with a digit. |

**Remarks**

- After the header come, in any order: top-level statements, genes, parts, functions, variants, at
  most one [background](#background) block, at most one [dance](#dance) block and any number of
  [pattern](#pattern-blocks-and-files) blocks.
- Comment lines directly below the header are the creature's description, which the app shows.
- The top-level statements run from the top each time the creature is built.
- Other files start with `background Name`, `dance Name` or `pattern Name` instead; see their
  entries.

**Example**

```
creature Snowball
// One white ball.

shape ball
lay
```

**See also:** [Files](LANGUAGE.md#3-files)

### breed

Says whether the app may mutate and breed the creature.

```text
breed off
breed on
```

**Used in:** a creature's top level, at most once.

**Remarks**

- `breed off` is for creatures whose children wouldn't keep their look. The app then won't mutate
  or breed them, but they can still be morphed and danced.
- `breed on` is the default, so it's never needed.

**Example**

```
creature Clock
breed off
```

**See also:** [Genetics](LANGUAGE.md#19-genetics)

### variant

Keeps another set of gene values alongside the creature's own.

```text
variant Name { gene = value; … }
```

| Parameter | Type      | Description                                                                                            |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Name`    | name      | The variant's name. Variants' names must differ from one another.                                      |
| `gene`    | full name | A gene's [full name](LANGUAGE.md#63-full-names), such as `petals`, `whorl.petals` or `background.hue`. |
| `value`   | any       | A constant value the gene could have: in its range, or one of its options.                             |

**Used in:** a creature's top level.

**Remarks**

- Each setting is on its own line, or separated by `;`. A gene can be set at most once in a variant.
- A variant only lists the genes it changes. Every other gene keeps the value on its own `gene`
  line, and follows that line if you change it later. In the example below, `Wide` doesn't mention
  `coils`, so it has 3 coils, like the creature itself.
- A creature that uses [random](#random) has a hidden gene, `seed`, which picks its random
  numbers. It has no `gene` line, but a variant can still set it: in the example, `seed = 42` gives
  `Wide` its own wiggle, while `Coiled` keeps the creature's seed, 0.
- Variants don't change what the program does. The app uses them where it wants a family of
  related creatures: a creature's morph loops through itself and then each variant in order.

**Example**

```
creature Cobra

gene hood  = 1.2 in 0.5..2
gene coils = 3   in 1..6 step 1

grow hood
repeat coils {
  yaw random(-20, 20)  // each coil bends a random way
  forward 1
  lay
}

variant Coiled { coils = 6; hood = 0.8 }

variant Wide {
  hood = 2
  seed = 42  // bends its coils other ways
}
```

| Gene    | The creature | `Coiled` | `Wide`                        |
| ------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `hood`  | 1.2          | 0.8      | 2                             |
| `coils` | 3            | 6        | 3, from the `gene coils` line |
| `seed`  | 0            | 0        | 42                            |

**See also:** [gene](#gene), [Variants](LANGUAGE.md#66-variants)

## 2. Genes, variables, parts and functions

### gene

Declares a value the app may change when it mutates, breeds and morphs the creature.

```text
gene name = value in min..max
gene name = value in min..max step size
gene name = value in min..max log
gene name = true
gene name = value from [option, option, …]
```

| Parameter | Type                                                                                    | Description                                                                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`    | name                                                                                    | The gene's name. It can't be a built-in name or `seed`.                                           |
| `value`   | number, vector, colour, bool or one of the options                                      | The creature's current value.                                                                     |
| `min`     | same type as `value`                                                                    | The smallest value the app may give it. For vectors and colours, each axis or channel separately. |
| `max`     | same type as `value`                                                                    | The largest value. Must be above `min`.                                                           |
| `size`    | number                                                                                  | With `step`: the gene only takes values `min`, `min + size`, `min + 2 × size`, …                  |
| `option`  | number, vector, colour, shape, pattern kind, scheme, finish, way of mixing or part name | The values a choice gene chooses from: at least two, all of one type.                             |

**Used in:** a file's top level, or directly inside a `part`, `function`, `background`, `dance`
or `pattern` body. Not inside `if`, loops, `branch`, `symmetric`, `lay { }` or `reshape { }`.

**Remarks**

- `log` makes mutation and morphing work by ratios, for sizes and speeds. `min` must be above 0,
  and `log` can't be used with `step`.
- A bool gene has no range: `gene spiky = true`.
- A colour gene's hue is a circle. `hsv(0, …)..hsv(360, …)` allows every hue. When the first hue
  is bigger, the range runs up through red: in the example, `warm` goes from 300 (magenta) through
  0 (red) to 40 (orange) ([Colour genes](LANGUAGE.md#64-colour-genes)).
- A gene whose options are part names is a part gene: calling it calls the part it names. In the
  example, `limb(2)` calls `leg(2)` or `fin(2)`, whichever `limb` holds. Every part in the list must
  take the same number of parameters ([Part genes](LANGUAGE.md#65-part-genes)).
- The value, range and options must be constant: literals, built-in constants and maths on them.
  Other genes, variables, `random`, `noise`, `time` and `music` aren't constant.
- A gene has one value for the whole creature, even if declared in a part that runs many times.
- Genes can't be assigned to.
- A `//` comment at the end of the line is the gene's description, shown by the app.
- A gene's full name is prefixed by where it's declared. In the example, `bend` is declared in
  `part leg`, so its full name is `leg.bend`. Genes in a background, a dance or a pattern start with
  `background.`, `dance.` or the pattern's name.

**Example**

```
creature Critter

gene petals = 7    in 3..16 step 1  // how many limbs
gene size   = 1    in 0.1..10 log
gene skin   = hsv(120, 0.6, 0.9) in hsv(60, 0.3, 0.5)..hsv(180, 1, 1)
gene warm   = hsv(20, 0.8, 1) in hsv(300, 0.5, 0.5)..hsv(40, 1, 1)
gene spiky  = true
gene body   = cone from [ball, cone, tube]
gene limb   = leg  from [leg, fin]

grow size
shape body
colour skin
lay
repeat petals as i {
  branch {
    roll 360 * i / petals
    pitch 90
    limb(2)
  }
}

part leg(reach) {
  gene bend = 30 in 0..90  // how far the legs bend
  colour warm
  pitch bend
  forward reach
  lay
}

part fin(reach) {
  if spiky {
    shape cone
  }
  colour warm
  forward reach
  lay { grow (1, 0.2, 2) }
}
```

**See also:** [variant](#variant), [Genes](LANGUAGE.md#6-genes), [Genetics](LANGUAGE.md#19-genetics)

### let

Creates a variable.

```text
let name = value
```

| Parameter | Type | Description                                            |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`    | name | The variable's name. It can't be a built-in name.      |
| `value`   | any  | Its first value. The variable can hold any type later. |

**Used in:** everywhere statements are allowed.

**Remarks**

- The variable lasts until the end of the block it's created in. Creating the same name twice in
  one block is an error; an inner block may create a name that hides an outer one.
- A top-level `let` makes a **global**. Parts can read and change globals; functions can only read
  them. A global can't be used before its `let` has run.

**Example**

```
let size = 1
repeat 5 {
  grow size
  lay
  size *= 0.8
}
```

**See also:** [assignment](#assignment), [Variables](LANGUAGE.md#7-variables)

### assignment

Changes a variable's value.

```text
name = value
name += value
name -= value
name *= value
name /= value
```

| Parameter | Type | Description                                                     |
| --------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`    | name | A variable created with `let`, or a parameter.                  |
| `value`   | any  | The new value, or what to add, subtract, multiply or divide by. |

**Used in:** everywhere except dance blocks.

**Remarks**

- `a += b` is `a = a + b`, and so on, with the same rules as the [operators](#operators).
  `list += [x]` adds an item to the end of a list, as `sizes += [i + 1]` does in the example.
- Genes, loop variables, `side` and globals inside a function can't be assigned to.

**Example**

```
let reach = 3
reach *= 0.5  // now 1.5

let sizes = []
repeat 4 as i {
  sizes += [i + 1]  // now [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

**See also:** [let](#let)

### part

Defines a piece of creature: code that moves the turtle and lays shapes. Calling it runs that code.

```text
part name(parameter, parameter, …) { … }
part name { … }
name(argument, argument, …)
name
```

| Parameter   | Type | Description                                                             |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | name | The part's name. Parts, functions and built-ins share one set of names. |
| `parameter` | name | A name for each value the part is given. Inside, it's a local variable. |
| `argument`  | any  | A value for each parameter, in order. Their number must match.          |

**Used in:** definitions at a creature's top level. Calls in creature code.

**Remarks**

- A part with no parameters can be defined and called without brackets, as `tail` is in the
  example.
- A part may move the turtle, lay shapes, call parts and functions, and change globals. It doesn't
  restore the turtle afterwards: put the call in a [branch](#branch) for that, as the example does
  for `leg`.
- `return` with no value leaves a part early. In the example, `leg` draws nothing when `reach` is 0
  or less.
- Parts can be used before they're defined, and can call themselves up to 200 calls deep.
- Genes declared in a part have the part's name in front: `leg.reach`.

**Example**

```
part leg(reach, bend) {
  if reach <= 0 {
    return
  }
  forward reach
  pitch bend
  lay
}

part tail {
  back 2
  lay
}

symmetric x {
  branch {
    yaw 90
    leg(2, 30)
  }
}
tail
```

**See also:** [function](#function), [Parts and functions](LANGUAGE.md#10-parts-and-functions)

### function

Defines a calculation that gives back a value.

```text
function name(parameter, parameter, …) { … }
name(argument, argument, …)
```

| Parameter   | Type | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | name | The function's name.                                           |
| `parameter` | name | A name for each value it's given.                              |
| `argument`  | any  | A value for each parameter, in order. Their number must match. |

**Returns:** the value of the `return` that ends it.

**Used in:** definitions at a creature's top level. Calls anywhere an expression is allowed in
creature code.

**Remarks**

- A function must end by returning a value with `return value`.
- It may read the turtle, globals and genes and call other functions. It must not move or change
  the turtle, lay shapes, call parts or change globals.
- Arguments are copies: changing a parameter doesn't change the caller's variable.

**Example**

```
function taper(i, n) {
  return 1 - i / n * 0.8
}

repeat 6 as i {
  branch {
    grow taper(i, 6)
    lay
  }
  forward 1
}
```

**See also:** [part](#part), [return](#return)

### return

Leaves a function with its value, or leaves a part early.

```text
return value
return
```

| Parameter | Type | Description                                       |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `value`   | any  | In a function, the value it gives back. Required. |

**Used in:** functions (with a value) and parts (without one).

**Example**

```
function half(x) {
  return x / 2
}
```

**See also:** [function](#function), [part](#part)

## 3. Control flow

### if

Runs a block only when a condition is true.

```text
if condition { … }
if condition { … } else { … }
if condition { … } else if condition { … } else { … }
```

| Parameter   | Type | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `condition` | bool | Must be `true` or `false`; `if 1` is an error. |

**Used in:** everywhere except dance blocks.

**Remarks**

- Any number of `else if` blocks may follow, and one `else` at the end.

**Example**

```
gene petals = 7 in 3..16 step 1

if petals > 10 {
  shape ball
} else if petals > 5 {
  shape cone
} else {
  shape cube
}
```

**See also:** [operators](#operators), [Control flow](LANGUAGE.md#9-control-flow)

### repeat

Runs a block a number of times.

```text
repeat count { … }
repeat count as i { … }
```

| Parameter | Type         | Description                                                                |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `count`   | whole number | How many times. Read once, when the loop starts. Below 1 runs it no times. |
| `i`       | name         | A read-only counter: 0 the first time, then 1, 2, … up to `count − 1`.     |

**Used in:** creature code, functions and pattern code.

**Example**

```
repeat 8 as i {
  branch {
    roll 45 * i
    forward 2
    lay
  }
}
```

**See also:** [for](#for), [while](#while)

### for

Runs a block for each value of a counter, from one number to another.

```text
for v from start to end { … }
for v from start to end by step { … }
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                   |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `v`       | name   | The read-only counter.                                                        |
| `start`   | number | The counter's first value.                                                    |
| `end`     | number | The last value it may take. `end` itself is included if the steps land on it. |
| `step`    | number | How much the counter changes each time. 1 if left out. Can't be 0.            |

**Used in:** creature code, functions and pattern code.

**Remarks**

- `start`, `end` and `step` are read once, when the loop starts.
- With a positive step the loop runs while `v ≤ end`. With a negative one it counts down, while
  `v ≥ end`: the second loop in the example gives `size` the values 1, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.25.

**Example**

```
for a from 0 to 315 by 45 {
  branch {
    yaw a
    forward 3
    lay
  }
}

for size from 1 to 0.25 by -0.25 {
  branch {
    grow size
    lay
  }
  forward 1
}
```

**See also:** [repeat](#repeat), [while](#while)

### while

Runs a block again and again for as long as a condition is true.

```text
while condition { … }
```

| Parameter   | Type | Description                           |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------------------------------- |
| `condition` | bool | Checked before each run of the block. |

**Used in:** creature code, functions and pattern code.

**Remarks**

- There's no `break`: something in the block must make the condition false. A loop that never ends
  is stopped by the build's step limit, with a warning
  ([Building a creature](LANGUAGE.md#20-building-a-creature)).

**Example**

```
let size = 1
while size > 0.1 {
  grow 0.7
  forward 1
  lay
  size *= 0.7
}
```

**See also:** [repeat](#repeat), [for](#for)

## 4. The turtle

The turtle starts at `(0, 0, 0)`, heading along z (towards the viewer), with up along y and its
side along x, size `(1, 1, 1)`. [The turtle](LANGUAGE.md#11-the-turtle) explains its state in full.

Inside [reshape](#reshape) and `lay { }` ([lay](#lay)), the commands in this section change the
shape transform instead of the turtle.

### forward

Moves the turtle along its heading.

```text
forward distance
```

| Parameter  | Type   | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `distance` | number | How far, in the turtle's own size: it moves `distance × turtle.size.z`. Negative moves backwards. |

**Used in:** creature code, `reshape { }` and `lay { }`.

**Example**

```
repeat 5 {
  lay
  forward 1
}
```

**See also:** [back](#back), [move](#move), [Moving](LANGUAGE.md#112-moving)

### back

Moves the turtle backwards along its heading. `back d` is `forward -d`.

```text
back distance
```

| Parameter  | Type   | Description                        |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `distance` | number | How far, in the turtle's own size. |

**Used in:** creature code, `reshape { }` and `lay { }`.

**Example**

```
back 2
lay
```

**See also:** [forward](#forward)

### move

Moves the turtle sideways, up and forward at once, without turning it.

```text
move offset
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `offset`  | vector | How far along the turtle's side axis (x), up axis (y) and heading (z), each in the turtle's size on that axis. |

**Used in:** creature code, `reshape { }` and `lay { }`.

**Example**

```
move (1, 2, 0)   // one to the side, two up
lay
```

**See also:** [forward](#forward)

### pitch

Tips the turtle's nose down or up, turning about its side axis.

```text
pitch angle
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                           |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `angle`   | number | Degrees. Positive tips the heading down, negative up. |

**Used in:** creature code, `reshape { }` and `lay { }`.

**Remarks**

- When the turtle is mirrored, every turn is the mirror image of what it would be unmirrored, so
  mirrored halves match.

**Example**

```
pitch -90   // now heading up
forward 3
lay
```

**See also:** [yaw](#yaw), [roll](#roll), [rotate](#rotate), [Turning](LANGUAGE.md#113-turning)

### yaw

Turns the turtle left or right, about its up axis.

```text
yaw angle
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `angle`   | number | Degrees. Positive turns the heading towards the side axis. |

**Used in:** creature code, `reshape { }` and `lay { }`.

**Example**

```
yaw 90
forward 2
lay
```

**See also:** [pitch](#pitch), [roll](#roll)

### roll

Rolls the turtle about its heading, like a plane rolling.

```text
roll angle
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                       |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `angle`   | number | Degrees. Positive turns the side axis towards up. |

**Used in:** creature code, `reshape { }` and `lay { }`.

**Example**

```
repeat 6 as i {
  branch {
    roll 60 * i
    pitch 90
    forward 2
    lay
  }
}
```

**See also:** [pitch](#pitch), [yaw](#yaw)

### rotate

Turns the turtle about any axis of its own.

```text
rotate angle around axis
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `angle`   | number | Degrees, by the right-hand rule about the axis.                                                                                                           |
| `axis`    | vector | The axis in the turtle's own terms: `axis.x` along its side, `axis.y` up, `axis.z` along its heading. It needn't be length 1. A zero vector does nothing. |

**Used in:** creature code, `reshape { }` and `lay { }`.

**Remarks**

- `rotate a around (1, 0, 0)` is the same as `pitch a`, `rotate a around (0, 1, 0)` as `yaw a`
  and `rotate a around (0, 0, 1)` as `roll a`.

**Example**

```
rotate 45 around (1, 1, 0)
lay
```

**See also:** [pitch](#pitch), [yaw](#yaw), [roll](#roll)

### grow

Changes the turtle's size. Everything after it moves further and lays bigger shapes.

```text
grow factor
grow factors
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `factor`  | number | Multiplies the size on every axis. A negative factor also mirrors all three axes.                                                    |
| `factors` | vector | Multiplies the side (x), up (y) and heading (z) sizes separately. Each negative part also reverses that axis and mirrors the turtle. |

**Used in:** creature code, `reshape { }` and `lay { }`.

**Remarks**

- Sizes multiply: `grow 2` twice makes the turtle 4 times its size.
- Each size stays with its own axis when the turtle turns.

**Example**

```
grow 2
lay
lay { grow (1, 0.2, 3) }   // a flat slab, this shape only
```

**See also:** [mirror](#mirror), [Growing and mirroring](LANGUAGE.md#114-growing-and-mirroring)

### mirror

Reverses one of the turtle's axes, so everything after it is a mirror image.

```text
mirror x
mirror y
mirror z
```

| Parameter | Type            | Description                                                     |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| axis      | `x`, `y` or `z` | The axis to reverse: the side (`x`), up (`y`) or heading (`z`). |

**Used in:** creature code, `reshape { }` and `lay { }`.

**Remarks**

- `mirror x` is the same as `grow (-1, 1, 1)`. It flips `turtle.mirrored`.
- [symmetric](#symmetric) is the usual way to draw two mirrored halves.

**Example**

```
mirror x
yaw 30      // turns the other way now
forward 2
lay
```

**See also:** [symmetric](#symmetric), [grow](#grow)

### branch

Runs a block, then puts the turtle back exactly as it was.

```text
branch { … }
```

**Used in:** creature code.

**Remarks**

- Everything about the turtle is saved and restored: position, direction, size, mirroring, shape
  transform, shape, colour, shine, sharpness, texture and wear.
- Variables changed inside aren't restored.

**Example**

```
repeat 5 as i {
  branch {
    yaw 72 * i
    forward 3
    lay
  }
}
```

**See also:** [symmetric](#symmetric), [Branches](LANGUAGE.md#115-branches)

### symmetric

Runs a block twice: once as it is, and once mirrored. Each run is in its own branch.

```text
symmetric x { … }
symmetric y { … }
symmetric z { … }
```

| Parameter | Type            | Description                             |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| axis      | `x`, `y` or `z` | The axis the second run is mirrored on. |

**Used in:** creature code.

**Remarks**

- Inside the block, the read-only variable `side` is `1` on the first run and `-1` on the
  mirrored run. In the example it makes one side red and the other blue.
- `symmetric x { … }` is `branch { … }` followed by `branch { mirror x; … }`.

**Example**

```
symmetric x {
  colour mix(blue, red, side * 0.5 + 0.5)
  yaw 90
  forward 2
  lay
}
```

**See also:** [mirror](#mirror), [branch](#branch), [Symmetry](LANGUAGE.md#116-symmetry)

### reshape

Changes the shape transform: an extra move, turn and stretch applied to every shape laid after it,
without moving the turtle.

```text
reshape { … }
```

**Used in:** creature code.

**Remarks**

- Inside the block, `forward`, `back`, `move`, `pitch`, `yaw`, `roll`, `rotate`, `grow` and
  `mirror` act on the shape transform, using its own axes and sizes. `let`, assignment and `if`
  are allowed too; nothing else is.
- It lasts until it's changed again or the enclosing [branch](#branch) ends.
- To change just one shape, use `lay { … }` ([lay](#lay)).

**Example**

```
reshape { grow (1, 0.3, 4) }
lay
forward 2
lay   // both shapes long and flat
```

**See also:** [lay](#lay), [The shape transform](LANGUAGE.md#117-the-shape-transform)

## 5. Shapes and material

### shape

Chooses the shape that later `lay`s lay.

```text
shape s
```

| Parameter | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `s`       | shape or number | One of the [shapes](#shapes), or a number that picks one: rounded, then `abs(n) % 6` in the order `tube`, `cube`, `cone`, `ball`, `ring`, `donut`. |

**Used in:** creature code.

**Remarks**

- The turtle starts with `ball`.
- The checker warns about a `shape` with no `lay` after it, which usually belongs before the `lay`
  it was meant for.

**Example**

```
shape cone
lay
```

**See also:** [lay](#lay), [Shapes](LANGUAGE.md#12-shapes)

### lay

Lays the current shape where the turtle is, in its current colour and material.

```text
lay
lay { … }
```

**Used in:** creature code.

**Remarks**

- The shape fits a 1 × 1 × 1 box centred on the turtle, scaled by the turtle's size. Its length
  axis, where it has one, is the heading.
- `lay { … }` changes the shape transform for this one shape only. Inside the block the same
  commands are allowed as in [reshape](#reshape).
- Each shape keeps the colour, shine, sharpness, texture and wear it was laid with.
- A build stops with a warning after 50,000 shapes.

**Example**

```
shape tube
lay { grow (0.3, 0.3, 4) }   // a long thin tube
```

**See also:** [shape](#shape), [reshape](#reshape)

### colour

Sets the colour of the shapes laid after it. `color` is the same word.

```text
colour c
color c
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                 |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `c`       | colour | A [colour name](#colour-names), [hsv](#hsv), [rgb](#rgb) or a hex colour such as `#ff8000`. |

**Used in:** creature code.

**Remarks**

- The turtle starts `white`.
- A gradient isn't a colour: sample it at a position, as `colour skin(0.3)` does in the example
  ([gradient](#gradient)).
- Alpha below 1 makes shapes see-through, like the last ball in the example.

**Example**

```
let skin = gradient(green, yellow)

colour hsv(30, 0.8, 1)
lay
forward 1
colour skin(0.3)
lay
forward 1
colour hsv(200, 1, 1, 0.4)
lay
```

**See also:** [hsv](#hsv), [Colours](LANGUAGE.md#131-colours)

### shine

Sets how strong the highlights are on the shapes laid after it.

```text
shine amount
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                        |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `amount`  | number | 0 (none, the start) to 1 (strong). Clamped to 0–1. |

**Used in:** creature code.

**Example**

```
shine 0.8
sharpness 0.9
lay
```

**See also:** [sharpness](#sharpness), [Material](LANGUAGE.md#132-material)

### sharpness

Sets how small and tight the highlights are on the shapes laid after it.

```text
sharpness amount
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                           |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `amount`  | number | 0 (broad and soft, the start) to 1 (small and sharp). Clamped to 0–1. |

**Used in:** creature code.

**Example**

```
shine 1
sharpness 0.2
lay
```

**See also:** [shine](#shine)

### texture

Sets the texture of the shapes laid after it.

```text
texture p
```

| Parameter | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| --------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `p`       | pattern | A texture made by [pattern](#pattern) or [mixed](#mixed), or [none](#none). |

**Used in:** creature code.

**Remarks**

- The turtle starts with `none`.
- A textured shape shows the texture's colours with a fifth of its own colour mixed in. [wear](#wear)
  says how much of the texture shows.

**Example**

```
texture pattern(marble, 200, 7, dusk, pearl)
lay
texture none
```

**See also:** [pattern](#pattern), [wear](#wear), [Textures](LANGUAGE.md#14-textures)

### wear

Sets how much of their texture the shapes laid after it show.

```text
wear amount
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `amount`  | number | 0 (just the shape's colour) to 1 (all texture, the start). Clamped to 0–1. |

**Used in:** creature code.

**Remarks**

- A gene for `wear` lets a creature fade its texture in and out as it morphs, dances and breeds.

**Example**

```
gene coat = 0.6 in 0..1

texture pattern(cells, 40, 3)
wear coat
lay
```

**See also:** [texture](#texture)

## 6. Backgrounds

### background

Gives the creature the background it's shown against. A background file holds the same contents
on its own.

```text
background { … }
background Name
```

| Parameter | Type | Description                     |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------------- |
| `Name`    | name | In a background file, its name. |

**Used in:** a creature's top level, at most once. `background Name` starts a background file.

**Remarks**

- The block may hold genes, `let`, assignment, `if` and exactly one [fill](#fill), which comes
  last. It may use the library, `time`, `beat` and `music`.
- It's self-contained: it can't lay shapes or use the creature's genes, variables, parts or
  functions. It may use the creature's own [pattern kinds](#pattern-blocks-and-files).
- Its genes' full names start with `background.`.
- Without one, the app shows its own default background.

**Example**

```
background {
  gene hue   = 260 in 0..360
  gene pulse = 30  in 0..90  // how far the colours shift with the bass

  fill pattern(aurora, hue + pulse * music.bass, 12)
}
```

**See also:** [fill](#fill), [Backgrounds](LANGUAGE.md#15-backgrounds)

### fill

Says what the background shows.

```text
fill p
```

| Parameter | Type                        | Description                                                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `p`       | pattern, colour or gradient | A pattern; a plain colour; or a gradient, 0 at the bottom of the view and 1 at the top. |

**Used in:** background blocks and files, as the last statement, exactly once.

**Example**

```
background {
  fill gradient(black, hsv(230, 0.8, 0.3))
}
```

**See also:** [background](#background)

## 7. Dance styles

### dance

Gives the creature its own dance style: how music moves the creature as a whole. A dance file
holds the same contents on its own.

```text
dance { … }
dance Name
```

| Parameter | Type | Description                |
| --------- | ---- | -------------------------- |
| `Name`    | name | In a dance file, its name. |

**Used in:** a creature's top level, at most once. `dance Name` starts a dance file.

**Remarks**

- The block holds genes, `let`s and at most one line for each effect: [morph](#morph),
  [zoom](#zoom), [spin](#spin), [turn](#turn), [reverse](#reverse) and [flat](#flat). An effect
  without a line is off.
- The block runs again at every moment of the dance, so inputs and settings can be expressions of
  `time`, `beat`, `music` and the block's genes and variables.
- Each effect's line starts with its name; the words after it can come in any order. Settings left
  out take their defaults.
- It's self-contained: it can't use the creature's genes or variables. Its genes' full names start
  with `dance.`.
- The app may switch to another style while the creature dances.

**Example**

```
dance {
  gene drive = 1.1 in 0.3..3  // how fast the music pushes the morph

  morph follows music.mid speed drive settle 2
  zoom follows music.level amount 0.5 settle 15
  spin follows music.bass_hit from 45 to 170 smooth 0.4
  turn on music.mid changes by 1
}
```

**See also:** [Dance styles](LANGUAGE.md#17-dance-styles)

### morph

Moves the creature along its morph loop (itself and its variants) at a speed the input sets. It
coasts to a stop when the input is quiet.

```text
morph follows x speed s settle t
```

| Setting   | Type   | Default | Description                                                                                     |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `follows` | number | —       | The input, 0–1 (clamped). The louder, the faster.                                               |
| `speed`   | number | 1       | Creatures a second at full input.                                                               |
| `settle`  | number | 2       | Seconds to coast to a stop from full speed when the input falls. It speeds up ten times faster. |

**Used in:** dance blocks and files.

**Example**

```
dance {
  morph follows clamp(music.mid * 1.5 - 0.2, 0, 1) speed 1.5
}
```

**See also:** [reverse](#reverse), [dance](#dance)

### zoom

Brings the creature towards the viewer as the input rises; it drifts back when the input falls.

```text
zoom follows x amount a settle t
```

| Setting   | Type   | Default | Description                                                                |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `follows` | number | —       | The input, 0–1 (clamped).                                                  |
| `amount`  | number | 0.5     | How much nearer it comes at full input: 0 not at all, 1 as near as it can. |
| `settle`  | number | 15      | Seconds to drift all the way back. It comes in fifty times faster.         |

**Used in:** dance blocks and files.

**Example**

```
dance {
  zoom follows music.level amount 0.3
}
```

**See also:** [dance](#dance)

### spin

Spins the creature about its spin axis, faster or slower with the input.

```text
spin follows x from slowest to fastest smooth t
```

| Setting   | Type   | Default | Description                                                   |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `follows` | number | —       | The input, 0–1 (clamped).                                     |
| `from`    | number | 45      | Degrees a second at input 0.                                  |
| `to`      | number | 170     | Degrees a second at input 1.                                  |
| `smooth`  | number | 0.4     | Seconds to swing to a new axis and speed. 0 switches at once. |

**Used in:** dance blocks and files.

**Remarks**

- With a [turn](#turn) line, the input is read each time the axis turns; without one, all the time.

**Example**

```
dance {
  spin follows music.bass_hit from 20 to 200 smooth 0.2
  turn on music.mid changes by 1
}
```

**See also:** [turn](#turn)

### turn

Gives the spin a new, random axis each time the input triggers.

```text
turn on x changes by d
turn on x drops by d
turn on x rises by d
```

| Setting | Type   | Default | Description                             |
| ------- | ------ | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `on`    | number | —       | The input, 0–1 (clamped).               |
| `by`    | number | 0.5     | How far the input must move to trigger. |

**Used in:** dance blocks and files.

**Remarks**

- While [flat](#flat) is on, `turn` only counts drops, whatever its line says.
- See [triggers and bursts](#triggers-and-bursts).

**Example**

```
dance {
  turn on music.high drops by 0.6
}

## 8. Pattern code

### pattern blocks and files

Makes a new pattern kind, written in GenoCode, that [pattern](#pattern) colours like a built-in one.

```text
pattern Name { … }
pattern Name
```

| Parameter | Type | Description                                                         |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Name`    | name | The new kind's name. It can't be a built-in name, part or function. |

**Used in:** a creature's top level, any number of times. `pattern Name` starts a pattern file.

**Remarks**

- The code runs once for each picture drawn, and ends with `value p`, where `p` is a
  [picture](#picture). Its numbers run from 0 (dark) to 1 (light); values outside are cut off.
- It may hold genes, `let`, assignment, `if`, `repeat`, `for`, `while` and `value`, and use the
  library and the [picture functions](#15-picture-functions). It can't use the turtle, shapes,
  `time`, `beat`, `music`, or the creature's genes, variables, parts or functions.
- [random](#random) draws from the recipe's seed, so each seed gives a different picture of the
  same kind, and always the same one.
- Its genes' full names start with its name: `Ripples.rings`.

**Example**

```
pattern Ripples
// Rings that wobble.

gene rings  = 8   in 2..20
gene wobble = 0.3 in 0..1

let turn = random(0, 360)
let lumps = clouds(5, 3)
value picture {
  let ripple = sin(r * rings * 180 + turn + lumps(x, y) * wobble * 360)
  value ripple * 0.5 + 0.5
}
```

**See also:** [Your own patterns](LANGUAGE.md#141-your-own-patterns)

### picture

Makes a picture by running a block once for every pixel.

```text
picture { … }
```

**Returns:** a picture.

**Used in:** pattern code, outside other `picture { }` blocks.

**Remarks**

- Inside the block, [x, y, r and a](#x-y-r-and-a) say where the pixel is, and the block ends with
  `value v`, the pixel's number.
- A picture named on its own inside the block is its value at this pixel, as `lumps` is in the
  example. `p(x, y)` reads it at another point.
- `random` and the picture functions can't be used inside. Draw random settings before the block,
  as the example does with `turn` and `lumps`.
- Reading any picture `p(x, y)` blends the four nearest pixels. Outside −1..1 the picture is
  folded back, as in a mirror: in the example, `lumps(x * 2, y)` reads past the edges.

**Example**

```
pattern Rings

let turn = random(0, 1)
let lumps = clouds(4, 2)
value picture {
  let rings = wave(r * 4 + turn) * 0.5 + 0.5
  value rings * 0.6 + (lumps + lumps(x * 2, y)) * 0.2
}
```

**See also:** [value](#value), [clouds](#clouds)

### value

| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `v`       | picture or number | At the end of a pattern, the picture. In `picture { }`, a number from 0 to 1. |

**Used in:** pattern code, as the last statement.

**Example**

```
pattern Soft

value blur(clouds(), 12)
```

**See also:** [picture](#picture)

### x, y, r and a

Where the pixel is, inside `picture { }`.

  value wave(a / 30) * 0.5 + 0.5
}
```

**Returns:** the same type as `a`. Like [mix](#mix), but it eases in and out: it moves slowly near
`a` and `b` and fastest in the middle. It's `mix(a, b, (1 − cos(180 × t)) / 2)`.

### mandel

```text
mandel(x, y)

number of steps of `z → z² + c` before `z` grows past 2, up to 64, divided by 64. 1 means it never
escaped.

**Example**

```
repeat 40 as i {

| `h`       | number | Hue in degrees: 0 red, 60 yellow, 120 green, 240 blue. Wrapped into 0–360. |
| `s`       | number | Saturation, 0 (grey) to 1 (full colour). Clamped.                          |
| `v`       | number | Value, 0 (black) to 1 (bright). Clamped.                                   |
| `a`       | number | Alpha, 0 (invisible) to 1 (solid, if left out). Clamped.                   |

**Returns:** colour.

**Example**

```
colour hsv(200, 0.8, 1)
colour hsv(0, 1, 1, 0.5)   // see-through red
```

**See also:** [rgb](#rgb), [colour names](#colour-names), [Colours](LANGUAGE.md#131-colours)

### rgb

```text
rgb(r, g, b)
rgb(r, g, b, a)
```

| Parameter     | Type   | Description                                              |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `r`, `g`, `b` | number | Red, green and blue, each 0 to 1. Clamped.               |
| `a`           | number | Alpha, 0 (invisible) to 1 (solid, if left out). Clamped. |

**Returns:** colour, kept as hue, saturation, value and alpha like every colour.

**Example**

```
colour rgb(1, 0.5, 0)   // orange, the same as #ff8000
```

**See also:** [hsv](#hsv)

### gradient

Makes a colour that changes along a line from 0 to 1.

```text
gradient(stop, stop, …)
gradient(colour at position, …)
skin(t)
```

| Parameter  | Type   | Description                                                     |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stop`     | colour | Two or more colours, each optionally followed by `at position`. |
| `position` | number | Where the stop is, from 0 to 1. Positions must not go down.     |
| `t`        | number | When sampling: where along the gradient, clamped to 0–1.        |

**Returns:** gradient. To get a colour out of it, write a position in brackets after it, as if
calling it: `skin(0.5)`.

**Remarks**

- Stops without a position: the first is at 0, the last at 1, and the others are spread evenly
  between their neighbours that have positions. In the example, `yellow` lands at 0.6, halfway
  between `red at 0.2` and `white at 1`.
- Two stops at the same position make a sharp edge, as in `flag`.
- Between stops colours blend as in [mix](#mix), hue the short way round.
- A gradient can be a [fill](#fill), as in the example's background, but `colour` needs a sampled
  colour.

**Example**

```
let skin = gradient(black, red at 0.2, yellow, white at 1)
repeat 20 as i {
  colour skin(i / 19)
  forward 1
  lay
}

let flag = gradient(blue, blue at 0.5, white at 0.5, white)
colour flag(0.7)  // white: past the edge
lay

background {
  fill gradient(black, hsv(230, 0.8, 0.3))
}
```

**See also:** [spectrum](#spectrum), [Gradients](LANGUAGE.md#133-gradients)

### spectrum

Like [gradient](#gradient), but hue moves in a straight line between stops, through every hue in
between, instead of the short way round.

```text
spectrum(stop, stop, …)
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stop`    | colour | As for [gradient](#gradient), with optional `at position`. |

**Returns:** gradient, sampled the same way.

**Remarks**

- `spectrum(blue, red)` goes from 240° down to 0°, through cyan, green and yellow;
  `gradient(blue, red)` goes through magenta.

**Example**

```
let rainbow = spectrum(hsv(0, 1, 1), hsv(300, 1, 1))
repeat 12 as i {
  colour rainbow(i / 11)
  forward 1
  lay
}
```

## 13. Noise and randomness

### noise

Smooth noise: a number that wanders gently up and down as its input changes.

```text
noise(x)
noise(v)
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                           |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `x`       | number | Where to read the noise along a line. |
| `v`       | vector | Where to read the noise in space.     |

**Returns:** number from −1 to 1.

**Remarks**

- The same input always gives the same result, so creatures built with it still morph smoothly.
- `noise(x)` is `noise((x, 0, 0))`. Inputs close together give close results; about 1 apart they
  are unrelated.
- It isn't constant, so it can't be used in gene declarations.

**Example**

```
repeat 30 as i {
  pitch 15 * noise(i * 0.3)
  yaw 15 * noise(i * 0.3 + 100)
  forward 0.5
  lay
}
```

**See also:** [fbm](#fbm), [random](#random), [Noise and randomness](LANGUAGE.md#185-noise-and-randomness)

### fbm

Fractal noise: [noise](#noise) with finer detail on top.

```text
fbm(x)
fbm(v)
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description                 |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| `x`       | number | Where to read it on a line. |
| `v`       | vector | Where to read it in space.  |

**Returns:** number from −1 to 1. Five layers of `noise`, each at twice the detail and half the
strength of the last.

**Example**

```
grow 1 + 0.3 * fbm(turtle.position)
lay
```

### random

A random number between two others.

```text
random(lo, hi)
```

| Parameter | Type   | Description             |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| `lo`      | number | The smallest it can be. |
| `hi`      | number | It's always below this. |

**Returns:** number, from `lo` up to but not including `hi`.

**Remarks**

- Random numbers are the same every build. They come from a sequence started by the creature's
  `seed` gene, which a creature gets automatically when it uses `random`. Mutating the creature
  can change its seed.
- In pattern code the sequence starts from the recipe's seed instead, and no `seed` gene is made.
- Unlike [noise](#noise), random numbers don't blend while morphing. Use `noise` for variation that
  should change smoothly.
- It isn't constant, so it can't be used in gene declarations.

**Example**

```
repeat 10 {
  branch {
    move (random(-3, 3), random(-3, 3), 0)
    grow random(0.3, 1)
    lay
  }
}
```

**See also:** [noise](#noise)

## 14. Texture functions

### pattern

Makes a texture from a short recipe.

```text
pattern(kind, hue, seed)
pattern(kind, hue, seed, scheme)
pattern(kind, hue, seed, scheme, finish)
```

| Parameter | Type         | Description                                                                      |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`    | pattern kind | One of the [pattern kinds](#pattern-kinds), or the creature's own.               |
| `hue`     | number       | The hue in degrees the colours are built round, as in [hsv](#hsv).               |
| `seed`    | whole number | Picks the layout and details. Each seed is a different picture of the same kind. |
| `scheme`  | scheme       | Which colours: one of the [schemes](#schemes). `jewel` if left out.              |
| `finish`  | finish       | The surface: one of the [finishes](#finishes). `matte` if left out.              |

**Returns:** pattern.

**Remarks**

- The same recipe always gives the same picture.
- Hue, scheme and finish only recolour the picture, so they can follow `time` and `music`
  smoothly. A new kind or seed draws a new picture, which takes a moment.
- All the arguments can be genes, so textures evolve with the creature. A pattern itself can't be
  a gene.

**Example**

```
gene coat_hue  = 200 in 0..360
gene coat_kind = marble from [marble, cells, aurora]

texture pattern(coat_kind, coat_hue, 7, dusk, pearl)
lay
```

**See also:** [mixed](#mixed), [texture](#texture), [fill](#fill), [Textures](LANGUAGE.md#14-textures)

### mixed

Mixes a second pattern kind into a pattern.

```text
mixed(p, way, kind, amount)
```

| Parameter | Type          | Description                                        |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `p`       | pattern       | The pattern to add to.                             |
| `way`     | way of mixing | How: one of the [ways of mixing](#ways-of-mixing). |
| `kind`    | pattern kind  | The kind of the second pattern.                    |
| `amount`  | number        | How much, from 0 to 1. Clamped.                    |

**Returns:** pattern.

**Remarks**

- The second pattern takes its layout from `p`'s seed, and the colours are always `p`'s.
- A pattern holds at most one second pattern: mixing a mixed pattern replaces it.
- Mixing `none` gives `none`.

**Example**

```
texture mixed(pattern(cells, 40, 3), warp, vortex, 0.6)
lay
```

**See also:** [pattern](#pattern)

## 15. Picture functions

These make and change [pictures](#picture). They can only be used in pattern code, outside
`picture { }`. Elsewhere their names are free: a creature may call a variable `stretch`.

### clouds

Random cloudy noise, the usual start of a pattern.

```text
clouds()
clouds(layers, grid)
```

| Parameter | Type         | Description                                                           |
| --------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `layers`  | whole number | How many layers of detail, 1 to 12. 6 if left out.                    |
| `grid`    | whole number | How many blobs across the first layer has, at least 1. 4 if left out. |

**Returns:** picture, from 0 to 1. Each layer is twice as fine and half as strong as the last.

**Remarks**

- It takes its numbers from the [random](#random) sequence, so each seed of the recipe gives
  different clouds.

**Example**

```
pattern Fog

value clouds(4, 2)
```

**See also:** [blur](#blur), [How they work](LANGUAGE.md#187-pictures)

### blur

Blurs a picture.

```text
blur(p, width)
blur(p, across, down)
```

| Parameter        | Type    | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `p`              | picture | The picture to blur.                                                                   |
| `width`          | number  | How far it blurs, in pixels of a picture 512 across, so it looks the same at any size. |
| `across`, `down` | number  | Different blurs across and down, for streaks.                                          |

**Returns:** picture.

**Example**

```
pattern Streaks

value blur(clouds(), 40, 2)
```

### zoom_blur

Streaks a picture outwards from the middle.

```text
zoom_blur(p, s)
```

| Parameter | Type    | Description                                                                         |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `p`       | picture | The picture to streak.                                                              |
| `s`       | number  | How long the streaks are: the picture is averaged enlarged from 1 to `1 + s` times. |

**Returns:** picture.

**Example**

```
pattern Rush

value zoom_blur(clouds(), 0.5)
```

### stretch

Stretches a picture so it uses the whole range from dark to light.

```text
stretch(p)
```

| Parameter | Type    | Description  |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ |
| `p`       | picture | The picture. |

**Returns:** picture whose darkest point is 0 and lightest is 1.

**Example**

```
pattern Bright

value stretch(blur(clouds(), 30))
```

### power

Raises every value of a picture to a power, to darken or lighten its middle tones.

```text
power(p, e)
```

| Parameter | Type    | Description                                              |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `p`       | picture | The picture.                                             |
| `e`       | number  | Above 1 darkens the middle tones, below 1 lightens them. |

**Returns:** picture.

**Example**

```
pattern Dark

value power(clouds(), 3)
```

## 16. Inputs

Read-only values from outside the program. They can be used anywhere except pattern code.

### time

```text
time
```

**Type:** number. Seconds since the creature started being shown, from 0 upwards. It keeps running
when no music is playing.

**Remarks**

- A creature that reads `time`, `beat` or `music` (outside its background and dance blocks) is
  rebuilt every frame. In still pictures, such as thumbnails, all three are 0.

**Example**

```
roll 45 * time   // turns 45 degrees a second
lay
```

**See also:** [Time and music](LANGUAGE.md#16-time-and-music)

### beat

```text
beat
```

**Type:** number from 0 to 1. Where the music is within the current beat: 0 on the beat, rising
towards 1 just before the next. 0 when no music is playing.

**Example**

```
grow 1 + 0.2 * bump(beat)
lay
```

### music

```text
music.part
```

**Type:** number from 0 to 1, whatever the volume. All are 0 when no music is playing.

| Part             | Description                                                            |

| `music.bass`     | Level of the low frequencies.                                          |
| `music.mid`      | Level of the middle frequencies.                                       |
| `music.high`     | Level of the high frequencies.                                         |
| `music.level`    | Overall loudness.                                                      |
| `music.hit`      | Jumps up on each onset (a drum hit, a note starting), then falls back. |
| `music.bass_hit` | Jumps up on each low onset, such as a kick drum or bass note.          |
| `music.mid_hit`  | Jumps up on each onset in the middle, such as a snare or a voice.      |
| `music.high_hit` | Jumps up on each high onset, such as a hi-hat or cymbal.               |

**Example**

```
gene flap = 30 in 0..70  // how hard the wings beat with the bass

symmetric x {
  roll 10 + flap * music.bass
  yaw 90
  forward 2
  lay
}
```

### turtle

Reads the turtle's current state.

```text
turtle.part
```

| Part               | Type    | Description                                            |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |

| `turtle.wear`      | number  | How much of its texture a shape shows.                 |

**Used in:** creature code and functions.

**Remarks**

- They describe the turtle, not the shape transform.

**Example**

```
while turtle.position.y < 5 {
  pitch -10
  forward 1
  lay
}
```

**See also:** [Reading the turtle](LANGUAGE.md#184-reading-the-turtle)

### shapes

Every shape fits a 1 × 1 × 1 box centred on the turtle. The number is the one [shape](#shape)
picks with a number.

| Name    | Number | Shape                                                                                 |

### pattern kinds

The first argument of [pattern](#pattern), and the third of [mixed](#mixed): `sunburst`, `vortex`,
`plasma`, `cells`, `kaleidoscope`, `interference`, `starburst`, `marble`, `lightning`, `aurora` and
`bloom`. Each is also written in GenoCode, in the `patterns` folder, as an example to read. A
creature's own [pattern blocks](#pattern-blocks-and-files) add more.

### schemes

The colours of a [pattern](#pattern).

| Name        | Colours                                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jewel`     | Deep, rich colours beside the hue, from dark to glowing. The default.       |
| `duotone`   | Two hues far apart, meeting in a soft neutral.                              |
| `split`     | The hue with the two beside its opposite, such as teal with coral and gold. |
| `analogous` | Close hues flowing into each other.                                         |
| `pastel`    | Light and soft.                                                             |
| `dusk`      | Cool shadows and warm lights.                                               |
| `electric`  | Near-black to a blazing colour and white, like neon.                        |

### finishes

The surface of a [pattern](#pattern).

| Name         | Surface                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `matte`      | Plain colours. The default.                                 |
| `metallic`   | Bright bands and white highlights, like polished metal.     |
| `iridescent` | The hue slides along, like oil on water or a beetle's back. |
| `pearl`      | Pale, with a soft pink-green-blue play of colour.           |
| `satin`      | A soft band of highlight.                                   |

### ways of mixing

How [mixed](#mixed) adds a second pattern.

| Name    | Mixing                                              |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `warp`  | The second pattern pushes the first one around.     |
| `blend` | The two patterns blended.                           |
| `mask`  | The first pattern shows where the second is bright. |
| `carve` | The second pattern is cut out of the first.         |

### none

No texture. `texture none` lays plain shapes again; mixing `none` gives `none`.

## 18. Values and operators

### literals

| Value  | Written as                    | Notes                                                                                              |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| number | `3`, `0.25`, `12.5e-3`, `90°` | A point needs a digit on both sides. `°` is allowed and does nothing. `-3` is minus applied to 3.  |
| bool   | `true`, `false`               |                                                                                                    |
| vector | `(1, 0, 0.5)`                 | Three numbers. `(a)` is just `a` in brackets.                                                      |
| colour | `#ff8000`, `#ff800080`        | Hex red, green, blue and optionally alpha. See also [hsv](#hsv) and [colour names](#colour-names). |
| list   | `[1, 2, 3]`, `[]`             | Any values, read by position from 0: `l[0]`.                                                       |
| string | `"text"`                      | Only in [print](#print). Escapes `\"`, `\\` and `\n`.                                              |

Comments are `//` to the end of the line, or `/* … */`.

### operators

From the loosest to the tightest:

| Operator                         | Meaning                                                                | Works on                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `a or b`                         | true if either is                                                      | bools. `b` is only worked out if `a` is false.            |
| `a and b`                        | true if both are                                                       | bools. `b` is only worked out if `a` is true.             |
| `not a`                          | the opposite                                                           | a bool                                                    |
| `a == b`, `a != b`               | equal, not equal                                                       | two values of the same type; lists item by item           |
| `a < b`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`         | comparisons                                                            | numbers. They don't chain: `a < b < c` is an error.       |
| `a + b`, `a - b`                 | add, subtract                                                          | numbers, two vectors; `+` also joins two lists            |
| `a * b`, `a / b`                 | multiply, divide                                                       | numbers; a vector and a number; two vectors, axis by axis |
| `a % b`                          | remainder, with `a`'s sign                                             | numbers: `-7 % 3` is −1                                   |
| `-a`                             | negate                                                                 | a number or vector                                        |
| `a ^ b`                          | power                                                                  | numbers. `2^3^2` is `2^9`; `-2^2` is −4.                  |
| `a.part`, `f(…)`, `g(t)`, `l[i]` | a part of a value, a call, sampling a gradient or picture, a list item |                                                           |

### parts of values

| Value  | Parts                                               |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| vector | `.x`, `.y`, `.z`                                    |
| colour | `.hue` (0–360), `.sat`, `.val`, `.alpha` (each 0–1) |

Parts are read-only: to change one, make a new value.

**Example**

```
let c = turtle.colour
colour hsv(c.hue + 30, c.sat, c.val)
```
