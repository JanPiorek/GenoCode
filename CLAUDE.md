# GenoCode: notes for Claude

GenoCode is a small language for creatures that dance to music, plus the web app to write, view,
breed, morph and dance them. Start with [README.md](README.md) for the layout and the app. The
contributing rules apply to every change:

@CONTRIBUTING.md

## Commands

- `npm run check`: build, type-check, test and check formatting, as CI does. Run it before every
  pull request.
- `npx vitest run packages/core/src/parser.test.ts`: run one test file.
- `npm run dev`: run the web app.
- `npm run format`: format with Prettier (print width 100).

## Where things are

- `docs/LANGUAGE.md` is the language specification and the final word on what the language means.
  `docs/REFERENCE.md` is the per-feature reference, and `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` the guide.
  `packages/core/src/docs.test.ts` checks that every example in them builds.
- `creatures/`, `dances/` and `patterns/` hold the starter creatures, dance styles and texture and
  background recipes, all as `.genie` files.
- The sibling repos GenoCode-cli, GenoCode-vscode and GenoCode-agent use `@genocode/core` and
  `@genocode/render` from npm. A change to core that they need is released here first.

## Rules to follow

- **One space between things.** Any code the engine writes or changes (formatter, variant and gene
  edits, paste, translator output, help text, docs examples) puts one space between things: no
  column alignment, no two spaces before a comment. Indentation (2 spaces) stays. Spacing a person
  types by hand is theirs: no test may require a layout of hand-written files. Ask before adding a
  new layout rule.
- **UI text is for a first-time user.** Tooltips, labels and messages say in plain words what the
  control does. Never "as in the original" or jargon the user hasn't met. Code comments may mention
  DancerDNA.
- **Docs remarks are shown in the example.** When a remark in `docs/` mentions some code or a
  feature, the entry's example uses it and the remark points at it ("in the example, …").
- **Variants are stages of one life.** A creature's variants and the creature itself form one loop
  that Morph plays through. Variants keep the same structure (the same number of legs, tentacles,
  …); parts appear and disappear by growing and shrinking smoothly, never by a jump in a count.
- **Nothing from DancerDNA,** and nothing that refers to files outside this repository.
- **Versions on 0.x:** a minor bump of `core` means `render` must widen its `core` dependency and
  be released too, because `^0.N.0` doesn't take `0.(N+1).0`.
